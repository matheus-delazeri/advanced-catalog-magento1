<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ‚úîÔ∏è An easier way to manage your catalog!

This module adds several tools to your Magento 1 that make time-consuming tasks easier and unecessary clicks avoided. It also adds new features that can help you and your customers to "go directly to what matters".

### ‚ö° Quick edit products

Most products are dynamic, we need to change it's price and stock frequently. Thinking in that, this module adds a shortcut in your admin product's grid that allows you to quickly update this info. Just click in the pencil icon, change the value and save it!

This also is applied to configurable's associated products grid, so you can quickly update their values after the creation:

[DEV NOTES]

This 'quick edit' function is handled by the renderer `MD_AdvancedCatalog_Block_Adminhtml_Catalog_Product_Edit_Renderer_Quick`. It's possible to use it in another fields and/or grid types.

### ‚ö° Quick create configurables

Creating configurable products can be a pain in the ass. Pre-creating attributes, create one associated product per time... It's a waste of time. Want to do it faster? Enable the `Quick Create Configurable` option in `System -> Configuration -> Advanced Catalog -> [Admin] Create Product` and create how many variations for your product as you wish!

![image](https://github.com/matheus-delazeri/advanced-catalog-magento1/assets/55641441/d59244c4-1c1b-4910-95bd-e43d65bd5999)

You only need to save the configurable product and all associated products will be created, even if their attribute's values doesn't exist!
e.g: if color `Red` does not exists in the attribute `color`, it will be automatically created.

#### - Setting custom attributes to associated products

It's also possible to specify custom attributes to be setted to all newly created simple products at `System -> Configuration -> Advanced Catalog -> [Admin] Create Product -> [Quick Create Configurable] Custom Attributes`. For example, by enabling the attribute `manufacturer`, it will be shown in a new section called 'Custom Attributes':

#### - Pre-creating configurable's attribute 

Instead of going to `Catalog -> Attributes -> Manage Attributes`, creating your new attribute (say `color`) and adding it to a group, you can simply provide the new attribute info in the new section added to configurable product's creation and hit 'Save'. The new attribute will be then available to use!

### üñºÔ∏è Display product image in admin's grid

This feature makes it better to visualize your products at the admin grid by showing their images as a miniature:

You can enable it at `System -> Configuration -> Advanced Catalog -> [Admin] Product Listing -> Display Image` and select which image field (Base Image, Small Image or Thumbnail) will be used in the display.

[DEV NOTES]

This module adds jQuery to your admin panel.

### ‚úñÔ∏è Bulk delete categories

Need to delete multiple categories and don't want to do the one-by-one process? Go to `Catalog -> Manage Categories` and click in the newly added 'Bulk Delete Categories' button. Then, just select which categories you want to delete and confirm it!

![image](https://github.com/matheus-delazeri/advanced-catalog-magento1/assets/55641441/7fda7598-e824-4c81-b7ae-f05e206ff0b1)

## ‚úîÔ∏è A best way to organize your catalog

Creating products efficiently is good, but nothing matters if your customers can't flow through them in a consice and direct way. Here are some features available in this module that will improve your customers navigation:

### üì¶ New sort orders available

Besides the default sort orders available (by position, attribute, etc), **5** new options can be added to catalog's sorting in your category's page and/or search results:
- Most Recent;
- Name A-Z;
- Name Z-A;
- Higher Price;
- Lowest Price;

![image](https://github.com/matheus-delazeri/advanced-catalog-magento1/assets/55641441/36ed6eb4-616b-456c-9c47-465df109e069)

It's possible to toggle this sort orders at `System -> Configuration -> Advanced Catalog -> Product Listing -> [Additional] Sort by`.

### üì¶ Out of stock products last

Rarely are the cases where customers want to see out of stock products alongside available ones. To fix that, you can enable `System -> Configuration -> Advanced Catalog -> Product Listing -> Out of Stock last` to onl show product's out of stock at the end of your category's page and/or search results.
